All these notebooks under model/ directory have been ran on google collab, due to some problems in setting up pytorch libraries for GCNN on local desktop.

The .npy files generated after Preprocessing/feature_extraction.ipynb are uploaded to google drive and these feature matrices are used as input to our model in Google Collab

Please make required changes in the block of code containing pip install commands if you are running locally.
