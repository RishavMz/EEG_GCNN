Folder structure:

Data - Would contain the dataset, preprocessed csv files and other csv files required for our model in various steps.
> Note: The dataset is not added to this folder structure due to its huge size (> 30 GB). URL for dataset is added under README file of DATA

Preprocessing - This folder contains the notebooks containing the code for preprocessing, feature extraction and analysis

Model - This folder contains the notebooks containing the code for the training and testing on our model.

> Note: As a result of restructuring of individual notebooks into folders, some refractoring might be necessary if file paths do not match in code. Please make these changes accordingly.
